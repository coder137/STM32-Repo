# STM32-Repo

STM32 Repository for learning HAL and CMSIS (Baremetal)

## Pre-Requisites

- arm-none-eabi-* toolchain
- CMake
- Ninja
- Clang Format
- VSCode (Integrated with above)

## Links

### STM32L4

- [STM32 Website for B-L475E-IOT01A](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html)
- STM32L475_x examples use [the B-L475E-IOT01A board](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Discovery-L475E-IOT01A/) 

### STM32F7

- [STM32 Website for NUCLEO-F746ZG](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f746zg.html)
- STM32F7ZG examples use [the NUCLEO-F746ZG board](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F746ZG/)

# Project Structure

**AIM:** Create a folder structure can would need minimal change when porting between different architectures and microcontrollers

In this below structure to port our project to a different controller we would need to update these folders
- l0_device_specific
- l1_third_party_device_specific
- l2_drivers

```
+-- l0_device_specific
| +-- arm_cmsis
| +-- linker_script
| +-- device_headers
| +-- device_startup
| +-- toolchain_specific_syscalls
+-- l1_third_party_device_specific
| +-- RTOS
| +-- External_Libraries_device_specific
+-- l2_drivers
| +-- gpio_device_specific
| +-- uart_device_specific
+-- l3_board_specific
| +-- peripheral_initialization
+-- l3_functional_third_party
| +-- ring_buffer
+-- l4_user_module
| +-- external_hardware
+-- l5_application
| +-- application_logic
| +-- main.c
```

## Device Dependent folders

- l0_device_specific
- l1_third_party_device_specific
- l2_drivers

### l0_device_specific

- ARM CMSIS 5 has different compiler and architecture specific changes
- ARM CMSIS 5 Linker script is dependent on architecture of microcontroller
- Device Header is dependent of the Microcontroller Manufacturer
- Device Startup is dependent on ARM Architecture and Microcontroller Manufacturer

### l1_third_party_device_dependent

- Certain Third Party software changes its behaviour based on the architecture and device
- For example: FreeRTOS needs to be configured differently according to different microcontroller family and architectures

### l2_drivers

- Basic drivers for **GPIO**, **Interrupt Handing**
- Basic protocol for **UART**, **SPI**, **I2C**
- These are microcontroller and architecture dependent

## Device Independent folders

- l3_functional_third_party
- l4_user_module
- l5_application

### l3_board_specific

- For internal board_specific initialization
- Syscalls based externed functions

### l3_functional_third_party

- Functional Third Party code integrated into the project
- For example: **Ring Buffer**, **JSON Library**

### l4_user_module

Writing code for various hardwares i.e

- Communication
- Sensors
- Actuators

### l5_application

- Application Logic for the project
- `main.c` resides on the top level
