# Meson Cross-compilation File Base using GCC ARM
# Requires that arm-none-eabi-* is found in your PATH
# For more information: http://mesonbuild.com/Cross-compilation.html

# *-gcc-ar is used over *-ar to support LTO flags.
# Without -gcc-ar, LTO will generate a linker warning:
# arm-none-eabi-ar: file.o: plugin needed to handle lto object

# NOTE: if we set `needs_exe_wrapper` to true, NO unit tests will run
# NOTE: if we do not set anything for the below flag i.e undefined, meson will make a guess whether we can run the unit-tests or no
# In this case it is better to set the flag to false and make sure no cross compiled targets are unit-tested
